# Morganton Day School Website
Hi,
This is not a real coding page, its just a place to put notes that everyone can see. You can add your own categories
and notes if you want.

Sketchy website where you can preview your page: https://htmlpreview.github.io/
Notes about CSS:
"Breakpoint" defines the point where the site will get smaller when the window size is reduced.
"Roots" are defined shades/hues for each color
